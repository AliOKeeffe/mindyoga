            <h2>About Mind Yoga</h2>
            <p>
                Mind yoga is a website detailing yoga poses to calm the mind. Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that
                focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The main
                components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility)
                and breathing. The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in other
                countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools,
                hospitals and surgeries.

                        awareness. In addition to its physical benefits, this pose can assist in calming and relaxing
                        the mind relieving anxious thoughts and feelings.

                        <li>Take a few breaths and find a place or object in the room to focus your attention. Slowly
                            shift your weight to your left leg and begin to raise your right foot off the floor. Align
                            the sole of your right foot with the inside of your left thigh. The toes should be pointing
                            down and your pelvis should be completely straight.</li>
