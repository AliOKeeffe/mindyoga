            <h1>About Mind Yoga</h1>
            <p>
                Mind yoga is a website detailing yoga poses to calm the mind. Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that
                focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The main
                components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility)
                and breathing. The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in other
                countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools,
                hospitals and surgeries.
