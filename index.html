            <h1>About Mind Yoga</h1>
            <p> 
                Mind yoga is a website detailing yoga poses to calm the mind. Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The main components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing. The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in other countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.

                <h2>Tree Pose (Vrksasana}</h2>
                <p>
                    This standing posture can help improve your balance, as well as your postural and body awareness. In addition to its physical benefits, this pose can assist in calming and relaxing the mindâ€”relieving anxious thoughts and feelings.

                <ol>
                    <li>Start by standing straight with a long, tall back and your feet aligned and touching. Your arms should be straight along either side of your body.</li>
                    <li>Take a few breaths and find a place or object in the room to focus your attention. Slowly shift your weight to your left leg and begin to raise your right foot off the floor. Align the sole of your right foot with the inside of your left thigh. The toes should be pointing down and your pelvis should be completely straight.</li>
                    <li>Stretch your arms straight up toward the ceiling with palms pressed together forming an inverted V.</li>
