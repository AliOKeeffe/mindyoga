            <h2>About Mind Yoga</h2>
            <p>
                Mind yoga is a website detailing yoga poses to calm the mind. Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that
                focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The main
                components of yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility)
                and breathing. The practice originated in India about 5,000 years ago and has been adapted in other
                countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools,
                hospitals and surgeries.

                    <h3>Anxiety - Upward Facing Dog Pose (Urdhva Mukha Svanasana)</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Upward-Facing Dog pose opens your heart, helping you remove any pent-up emotions in your chest.
                        This stretch from head to toe keeps a special focus on the spine. Stress and anxiety trigger
                        cortisol release, which stimulates "trigger" points, often along our spine, in our
                        parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. By focusing on releasing these points through
                        upward-facing dog pose and learning to be present, our stress response, cortisol, and adrenaline
                        levels can become more balanced and, in turn, shift our brain chemistry.

                    <h3>Grief - Uttanasana (Standing Forward Fold)</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Forward bending Yoga poses are soothing and nourishing. Forward Folds also help to calm you down
                        because they encourage you to relax into the pose while pulling your senses inward, which allows
                        you to rest for a few moments in your own inner essence. Forward Bending Yoga poses also allow
                        you to curl your body into itself while protecting your heart and abdominal areas. Additionally,
                        Forward Folds open up your hips and first chakra area, which releases stagnant survival energy
                        and helps you to feel more empowered and grounded.

                    <ol>
                        <li>At the back of the mat, step your feet hip-width distance apart and on an exhalation, fold
                            over your legs.</li>
                        <li>If you are able, rest the crown of your head on a block, which can be incredibly
                            restorative. Otherwise, simply let your head hang.</li>
                        <li>Your arms will dangle loosely, palms on the floor or clasp opposite elbows.</li>

                        <li>Round your way to standing, very slowly, one vertebra at a time. Let your head be the last

                    <h3>Trauma - Child's Pose (Balasana)</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        This is a heart opening pose when performed with an open mind, the full-body, gravitational pull
                        induces a great sense of physical, mental, and emotional relief. It releases tension in the
                        shoulders, neck, back, and hips too. This pose also helps to promote relaxation by encouraging
                        steady conscious breathing, which is particularly great for trauma sufferers due to a calming of
                        the sympathetic nervous system.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Begin on your hands and knees with your big toes touching. Your hands should be directly
                            under your arms, and your legs should be hip-distance apart.</li>
                        <li>Exhale as you bow forward allowing your torso to rest on or between your thighs with your
                            forehead on the mat. Keeping your arms long and extended, press into your hands keeping your
                            sitz bones on your heels.
                        </li>
                        <li>Hold this pose for as long as you need to. When finished, slowly use your hands to walk your
                            torso upright and sit back on your heels.</li>

                    <p>
                        Tree pose is fundamental in easing stress. By implementing basic standing balances, you promote concentration, focus, and awareness, with the intention of taking your mind away from stress and placing your attention on your physical self.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Start by standing straight with a long, tall back and your feet aligned and touching. Your
                            arms should be straight along either side of your body.</li>
                        <li>Take a few breaths and find a place or object in the room to focus your attention. Slowly
                            shift your weight to your left leg and begin to raise your right foot off the floor. Align
                            the sole of your right foot with the inside of your left thigh. The toes should be pointing
                            down and your pelvis should be completely straight.</li>
                        <li>Stretch your arms straight up toward the ceiling with palms pressed together forming an
                            inverted V.</li>
