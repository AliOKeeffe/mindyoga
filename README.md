# Mind Yoga

Mind Yoga is a website that aims to teach users specific yoga poses to improve their mental wellbeing. The site is intended for users who wish to practice yoga in order to release difficult emotions such as stress, anxiety, trauma and grief. 

Mind Yoga includes step by step instructions for each specific pose along with images and a description of the benefits for each emotional state. Users who wish attend a yoga class can use the Google Maps section to find a class in their local area (DO I NEED TO SAY WHERE?).

The site also includes a form section for users who wish to contribute their own suggested poses.
