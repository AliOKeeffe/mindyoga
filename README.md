# Mind Yoga

Mind Yoga is a website that aims to teach users specific yoga poses to improve their mental wellbeing. The site is intended for users who wish to practice yoga in order to release difficult emotions such as stress, anxiety, trauma and grief. 

Mind Yoga includes step by step instructions for each specific pose along with images and a description of the benefits for each emotional state. Users who wish to attend a yoga class can use the Google Maps section to find a class in their local area. The site also includes a form section for users who wish to contribute their own suggested yoga poses.

## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used on the Mind Yoga site is very important to the overall experience of the user. A nature theme is consistently used across all imagery with lots of green foliage and forest scenes. This gives the sense of grounding in nature which has great benefits for mental health and is intended to invoke a sense of calm in the user. The colour green is also important as this ties into the main colour scheme of the site. 

### Colours
The colour scheme of the website is white and green with varying shades of green used to tie in with the nature imagery. A dark grey font is used which has a good contrast with the light green and white backgrounds making it easy to read. 

### Fonts
The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Links Testing
- All navigation links were tested manually to ensure the user is directed to the correct section of the website.
- Social Media links in the footer of each page were tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the correct page and open in a new tab. 

### Browser Testing
- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari browsers with no issues noted.
    
### Device Testing
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 8, iPhoneX and iPad to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. The website performed as intended. The responsive design was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes.
- I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:
    - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faliokeeffe.github.io%2Fmindyoga%2F)
    - [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faliokeeffe.github.io%2Fmindyoga%2F)


### Friends and Family User Testing
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs
#### Anchor link scroll with a fixed position header
- The header element contains anchor links to allow the user to navigate to different sections within the website. By default, these will scroll so that the target element is flush with the top of the browser window.
- When I updated the header to use a fixed top position, the beginning of each section ended up being covered by the header, which wasnâ€™t ideal.
- To resolve this I created div elements at the top of each section and applied a relative position with a -75px top position (the same height as the header). This way, when the user clicks on a nav link, the browser window scrolls to the top of the corresponding section. 

#### Using padding on elements with 100% width / CSS Box Model
- When I first implemented my section elements I set them to use a width of 100%. When I later added content to some of these, I applied padding to create more space for the text and images. 
- I did not expect the padding to be added to the width of the content box of the Section and didnâ€™t understand why the Sections with added padding rendered at a different size to those that did not. 
- I read up a bit more about the CSS Box Model and then implemented a new Div element with no defined width inside of the relevant Section elements, on which I was able to apply the required padding, while ensuring that the width of 100% was applied to all Section elements consistently.

### Known Bugs
HTML Smooth Scroll does not work on Safari browser.
